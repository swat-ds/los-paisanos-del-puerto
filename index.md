What is the experience of being both Black and Latina? How do Spanish-speaking Blacks in Philadelphia express their identities? This digital humanities project features the voices of Latinx people, offering a series of podcast episodes and interactive web content that analyzes the interconnected expressions of language and identity in the African Diaspora. AfroLatinx Podcast™ is the collaborative effort of students in the Spring 2017 linguistics seminar, *Language and Identity in the African Experience: From Kenya to Mexico*, with instructor, Professor Jamie A. Thomas at Swarthmore College. 

These podcast episodes draw upon our seminar visits to Taller Puertorriqueño in North Philadelphia, where we spoke with artists, small business owners, students, and others. Through these opportunities to interact with community stakeholders, we learned how language, race, gender, and nationality each mediate the legibility of Blackness as part of Latinx identity. Our intention with this project is to amplify the complex and dynamic nature of the experiences of African-descended people across the Americas. This imperative patterns with the transnational impetus of our seminar course, which began with an encounter of Blackness in America through James Baldwin’s *The Fire Next Time*, and concluded with readings of Chege Githiora’s *Afro-Mexicans: Discourse of Race and Identity in the African Diaspora*, and Laura A. Lewis’ *Chocolate and Corn Flour*.
