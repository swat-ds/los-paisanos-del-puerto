### Spanish

*I: En Puntarenas era muy difícil. Porque nunca, osea, era como “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Entonces, [my ex-novia y yo] were like very close friends, to everyone, it’s like, our friends did know, but we were always like low-profile. Always hanging out together but never showing like, care -*

*D: Affection?*

*I: Affection, yeah. That’s why we always were at home. But for me it was never difficult. But for her it was. Even though I was the Chinese one. Uno espera que los chinos sean más conservadores verdad? Uno espera que los chinos son más tradicionales pero mi familia has been always okay with it*

*I: Eh nuclear, my mom, mamá. Porque mi papá murió cuando yo era muy niña entonces mi mamá. Pero mi mamá worked for the college, Universidad de Costa Rica since always. Y usted sabe que los universidades siempre más liberales.. Exactamente. Las universidades siempre son más progresistas, ven hacia el futuro.*

*D: Tenía una experiencia de coming out?*

### English

Iris: En Puntarenas it was really difficult. Because I never, you know, it was like, “don’t ask, don’t tell.” And so, [my ex-girlfriend and I]  were like very close friends, to everyone, it’s like, our friends did know, but we were always like low-profile. Always hanging out together but never showing like, care -


D: Affection?

I: Affection, yeah. That’s why we always were at home. But for me it was never difficult. But for her it was. Even though I was the Chinese one. One would think that the Chinese are more conservative right? One would think that the Chinese are more traditional, but my family has been always okay with it.

D: Your family referring to…?

I: Eh nuclear, my mom, mamá. Because my father died when I was really young, so my mom. But she worked for the college, Universidad de Costa Rica since always. And you know the universities are always more liberal. Exactly. The universities always have [the standard of being forward.]

D: Did you have an experience coming out?

No. Coming out from what? I was never…no no no .. I always thought that straight people never come out. From where? What closet?
