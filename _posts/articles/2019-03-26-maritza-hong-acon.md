# Transcription

#### English

Maritza: When I was growing up here, I felt a lot of racism here, here in Puntarenas. People in the street, my father --

Dorcas: How?

M: How? Making fun of him, uh, because we were Chinese, you know, saying that same thing, and my older brother felt more racism because he was the oldest one. Um, I remember one time he was coming from high school and --

D: Is that [Liceo/High School] Jose Marti?

M: [Liceo/High School] José Martí, yes. He was just getting here to the house already in the corner and some guy - I don't know who was it - he was eating an orange and so people here eat the orange like this: squeezing it and then you get the stuff out, right? So he would just grab that and then throw it at you, throw it at you, just because you are Chinese. And they feel like they are - they have the right to do that.
